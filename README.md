# awesome bevy

Yet another list of awesome (and hopefully up-to-date as of 0.15) crates and resources I have used for Bevy game development. I only provide a brief description of what I have used them for - see their respective documentation for their full capabilities.

In alphabetical order until there are enough to categorize.

- [`avian`](https://github.com/Jondolf/avian) - 2D and 3D ECS-based physics. Straightforward to setup physics and colliders of all sorts.

- [`blenvy`](https://github.com/kaosat-dev/Blenvy) - A crate (and Blender plugin) that bridges Blender level design and Bevy in a fairly seamless way. 

- [`bevy_hanabi`](https://github.com/djeedai/bevy_hanabi) - Awesome geometric particle effects, limited only by your imagination.

- [`bevy_mod_outline`](https://github.com/komadori/bevy_mod_outline) - Outline meshes with lines of different color and thickness.

- [`bevy_spatial`](https://github.com/laundmo/bevy-spatial) - Spatial data structures for Bevy. I used its KD Tree implementation for nearest-neighbor lookups in dense scenes.

- [`ron`](https://github.com/ron-rs/ron) - Rusty Object Notation. Easy to load up assets and other game components defined in RON files. Bevy-centric use available through the [`bevy_common_assets`](https://github.com/NiklasEi/bevy_common_assets) crate.
